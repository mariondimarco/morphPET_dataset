This repository contains the datasets used in the paper "A Study on Accessing Linguistic Information in Pre-Trained Language Models by Using Prompts" (2023) 

For each language and category, there are four files (dev.tsv, eval.tsv, train.tsv, unlabeled.tsv) containing the different prompts and the label.
